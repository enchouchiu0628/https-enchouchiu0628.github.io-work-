      <p>The BMW E90/E91/E92/E93 Series is the fifth generation of the BMW 3 Series, which was produced from 2004 to 2013. The body styles of the range are:

    4-door Sedan/Saloon (E90 Model Code)
    Estate/Wagon (E91 Model Code, marketed as "Touring")
    Cabriolet (E93 Model Code)
    Due to the separate model codes for each body style, the term "E9X" is sometimes used to describe this generation of the 3 Series.

 
    The E90/E91 sedans and wagons began to be phased out following the introduction of their F30/F31 successors in 2012. However, the E92/E93 coupes and cabriolets remained in production until 2013,[7] when they were replaced by the F32/F33 models.

    The E90/E92/E93 M3 is the only generation of M3 to be powered by a V8 engine. Released in 2007,[8] it uses BMW's S65 engine and was produced in sedan, coupe and cabriolet body styles<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Danger馬上預約</button>
